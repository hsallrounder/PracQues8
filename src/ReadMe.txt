Q1.
Brackets Balanced

For a given a string expression containing only round brackets or parentheses, check if they are balanced or not.
Brackets are said to be balanced if the bracket which opens last, closes first.
Example:
Expression: (()())
Since all the opening brackets have their corresponding closing brackets,
we say it is balanced and hence the output will be, 'true'.
You need to return a boolean value indicating whether the expression is balanced or not.
Note:
The input expression will not contain spaces in between.
Input Format:
The first and the only line of input contains a string expression without any spaces in between.
 Output Format:
The only line of output prints 'true' or 'false'.
Note:
You don't have to print anything explicitly. It has been taken care of. Just implement the function.
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^7
 Where N is the length of the expression.

Time Limit: 1sec
Sample Input 1 :
(()()())
Sample Output 1 :
true
Sample Input 2 :
()()(()
Sample Output 2 :
false
Explanation to Sample Input 2:
The initial two pairs of brackets are balanced. But when you see, the opening bracket at the fourth index doesn't
have its corresponding closing bracket which makes it imbalanced and in turn, making the whole expression imbalanced.
Hence the output prints 'false'.


Q2.
Reverse Stack

You have been given two stacks that can store integers as the data.
Out of the two given stacks, one is populated and the other one is empty.
You are required to write a function that reverses the populated stack using the one which is empty.
For Example:
Alt txt

Input Format :
The first line of input contains an integer N, denoting the total number of elements in the stack.

The second line of input contains N integers separated by a single space,
representing the order in which the elements are pushed into the stack.
Output Format:
The only line of output prints the order in which the stack elements are popped, all of them separated by a single space.
Note:
You are not required to print the expected output explicitly, it has already been taken care of.
Just make the changes in the input stack itself.
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^3
-2^31 <= data <= 2^31 - 1

Time Limit: 1sec
Sample Input 1:
6
1 2 3 4 5 10
Note:
Here, 10 is at the top of the stack.
Sample Output 1:
1 2 3 4 5 10
Note:
Here, 1 is at the top of the stack.
Sample Input 2:
5
2 8 15 1 10
Sample Output 2:
2 8 15 1 10
